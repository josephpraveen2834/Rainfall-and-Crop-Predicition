# Rainfall-and-Crop-Predicition-using-Hybird-Random-Forest-and-Adaboost


This project aims to predict rainfall and recommend suitable crops based on weather conditions. It incorporates machine learning models to predict rainfall and suggest crops, providing valuable insights for farmers and agricultural enthusiasts.

### Features

1. **Rainfall Prediction:**
   - Utilizes machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Neural Network, and a hybrid of Random Forest and Adaboost to predict rainfall based on various weather parameters.
   - Visualizes relationships between rainfall and weather features using scatter plots.

2. **Crop Recommendation:**
   - Recommends crops based on factors like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, temperature, humidity, pH of the soil, precipitation, and weather events.
   - Implements machine learning classifiers like Random Forest, Neural Network, and a hybrid of Random Forest and Adaboost for accurate crop recommendations.

### Contents

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleans the dataset by removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values.
   - Converts categorical data into numerical format using label encoding.

2. **Rainfall Prediction:**
   - Utilizes machine learning models like Random Forest, Neural Network, and hybrid classifiers to predict rainfall.
   - Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Provides visualizations of scatter plots showcasing the relationship between rainfall and weather parameters.

3. **Crop Recommendation:**
   - Recommends crops based on weather and soil conditions using machine learning classifiers.
   - Assesses model accuracy and performance metrics to ensure reliable crop recommendations.
   - Visualizes feature distributions and probability plots for better understanding of data characteristics.

4. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - Presents performance evaluation of rainfall prediction and crop recommendation models through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
   - Includes visualizations depicting the comparative performance of different machine learning algorithms.
